overall idea here is to use file name in a dataframe
a folder has all the images

create a database where file name is the first column, 
each entry will have a file name, atributes will have 4 or 5 others.

a test function { # of question, which bias file to use, sequntial mode is false}
will first create a test log file with time stamp in log folder
then have time stamp

for loop

random generater, function is look at biase weight >=0 entry

the program will use steve's function to open a image file. then ask for input to be type in the atribuates

then another function to check if the input atributes match with the stored atrubutes.

if the comparison is true, such entry will have bias weight -1
if the comparison is false, such entry will have bias weight +1 in the [biase file]
